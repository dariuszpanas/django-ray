## 1. Django 6 Task Framework Gap Analysis

### 1.1 What Django 6 Provides

Django 6.0 introduced a native task framework ([docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/tasks/)) with:

1. **`@task` decorator** - Marks functions as background tasks
2. **`.enqueue()` method** - Schedules task execution
3. **`TaskBackend` ABC** - Interface for task execution backends
4. **Task result retrieval** - Built-in result handling

```python
# Django 6 native pattern
from django.tasks import task

@task
def my_task(arg1, arg2):
    return result

# Enqueue for execution
result = my_task.enqueue(arg1, arg2)
```

### 1.2 Current django-ray Implementation

**The project completely ignores Django 6's task framework.** Instead, it implements a parallel, independent system:

```python
# Current django-ray pattern (testproject/tasks.py)
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Plain function - no decorator"""
    return a + b

# Enqueue via direct model creation (testproject/api.py)
task = RayTaskExecution.objects.create(
    task_id=f"api-add-{RayTaskExecution.objects.count() + 1}",
    callable_path="testproject.tasks.add_numbers",
    queue_name=queue,
    state=TaskState.QUEUED,
    args_json=serialize_args([a, b]),
    kwargs_json="{}",
)
```

### 1.3 Gap Summary (RESOLVED)

> **Status Update:** These gaps have been addressed as of January 18, 2026.

| Django 6 Feature | django-ray Status | Impact |
|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| `@task` decorator | ✅ **Implemented** | Tasks in `testproject/tasks.py` now use `@task` |
| `.enqueue()` method | ✅ **Implemented** | `/v2/` API endpoints use `.enqueue()` |
| `TaskBackend` ABC | ✅ **Implemented** | `RayTaskBackend` in `backends.py` |
| `Task` result objects | ✅ **Implemented** | `TaskResult` returned from enqueue |
| Task discovery | ⚠️ Partial | Via import, no auto-discovery yet |
| `TASKS` setting | ✅ **Implemented** | Configured in `testproject/settings.py` |

### 1.4 Architectural Consequence (RESOLVED)

> **Status Update:** These issues have been addressed.

The implementation now provides a **proper Django 6 task backend**:

1. ✅ Can use Django's native `@task` decorator
2. ✅ Can use Django's `.enqueue()` API  
3. ✅ Can swap backends (configure via `TASKS` setting)
4. ✅ Interoperable with other Django task backends
5. ✅ Task definitions are Django-aware

---

## 2. Ray Execution Mode Analysis

### 2.1 Planned Architecture (from ARCHITECTURE.md)

The architecture document specifies two execution modes:

1. **Ray Job Submission API (MVP)** - `runner/ray_job.py`
2. **Ray Core (`ray.remote`)** - `runner/ray_core.py`

### 2.2 Actual Implementation

| Mode | Implemented | Used in Production | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Sync Mode (`--sync`) | ✅ Yes | Testing only | Direct execution, no Ray |
| Local Mode (`--local`) | ✅ Yes | **Primary mode** | Uses `ray.remote` inline |
| Cluster Mode (`--cluster`) | ✅ Yes | K8s deployments | Uses `ray.remote` inline |
| Ray Job API | ⚠️ Partial | **Not used** | `RayJobRunner` exists but has issues |

### 2.3 Critical Finding: Ray Job API Not Used

The `django_ray_worker.py` command has **three paths**:

```python
def process_task(self, task: RayTaskExecution) -> None:
    if self.execution_mode == "sync":
        self.execute_task_sync(task)           # Direct call
    elif self.execution_mode in ("local", "cluster"):
        self.execute_task_local_ray(task)      # ray.remote inline
    else:
        self.submit_task_to_ray(task)          # RayJobRunner - RARELY USED
```

**The default mode (when no flags) attempts Ray Job API, but:**
- Documented as having "issues with `uv run` not being in PATH"
- No working production deployment uses it
- K8s deployments use `--cluster` flag (ray.remote mode)

### 2.4 ray.remote Implementation Issues

The current `--local` and `--cluster` modes define a `ray.remote` function **inline** within the worker:

```python
def execute_task_local_ray(self, task: RayTaskExecution) -> None:
    @ray.remote(name=f"django_ray:{task_name}")
    def run_task(callable_path, args_json, kwargs_json, task_id):
        from django_ray.runtime.entrypoint import execute_task
        return execute_task(callable_path, args_json, kwargs_json)
    
    result_ref = run_task.remote(...)
```

**Problems:**
1. Function redefined on every task submission
2. No reuse of Ray actors or function definitions
3. Dashboard shows repetitive task definitions
4. Not using the `RayCoreRunner` from `runner/ray_core.py`

---

## 3. Feature Implementation Status

### 3.1 Completed vs Planned (Phase 1: MVP)

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1.1 Django app + models | ✅ Done | `RayTaskExecution` model works |
| 1.2 Settings and configuration | ✅ Done | Settings module functional |
| 1.3 Worker management command | ✅ Done | Works but doesn't use planned runners |
| 1.4 Claiming implementation | ✅ Done | `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` |
| 1.5 Ray Job execution adapter | ⚠️ Exists | Not used in practice |
| 1.6 Execution entrypoint | ✅ Done | `runtime/entrypoint.py` |
| 1.7 Result store (DB) | ⚠️ Stub | `results/db.py` is placeholder |
| 1.8 Admin UI | ✅ Done | Basic admin works |

### 3.2 Phase 2: Reliability (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 2.1 Heartbeats | ⚠️ Partial | Field exists, updates incomplete |
| 2.2 Stuck detection / LOST state | ⚠️ Partial | Logic exists, not integrated in loop |
| 2.3 Retry policy | ⚠️ Partial | `retry.py` has logic, not wired up |
| 2.4 Cancellation improvements | ⚠️ Partial | `cancellation.py` has logic, not wired up |

### 3.3 Phase 3: Throughput Mode (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 3.1 Ray Core adapter | ❌ Stub | `RayCoreRunner` raises NotImplementedError |
| 3.2 Per-queue concurrency | ❌ Not done | Global only |

### 3.4 Phase 4: Ecosystem (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| 4.1 Metrics endpoint | ❌ Stub | `prometheus.py` is placeholder |
| 4.2 Tracing hooks | ❌ Not done | |
| 4.3 External result store | ❌ Stub | `external.py` is placeholder |
| 4.4 Deployment examples | ✅ Done | K8s manifests exist |

---

## 4. Technical Debt Inventory

### 4.1 Placeholder Modules (No Implementation)

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `runner/ray_core.py` | Ray Core execution | `NotImplementedError` |
| `runner/retry.py` | Retry logic | Has code, not integrated |
| `runner/reconciliation.py` | Stuck task detection | Has code, not integrated |
| `runner/cancellation.py` | Task cancellation | Has code, not integrated |
| `runner/leasing.py` | Worker leasing | Only `generate_worker_id()` |
| `results/db.py` | DB result storage | Empty placeholder |
| `results/external.py` | S3/GCS storage | Empty placeholder |
| `metrics/prometheus.py` | Prometheus metrics | Empty placeholder |
| `runtime/redaction.py` | Sensitive data redaction | Placeholder |

### 4.2 Code Duplication / Inconsistency

1. **Task submission logic is duplicated:**
   - `execute_task_local_ray()` - inline ray.remote
   - `submit_task_to_ray()` - uses RayJobRunner
   - These should share common abstractions

2. **Result handling is inconsistent:**
   - Sync mode stores result directly
   - Local Ray mode stores result after polling
   - Ray Job mode parses logs for results

3. **No use of `BaseRunner` abstraction:**
   - `RayJobRunner` implements `BaseRunner`
   - `RayCoreRunner` is a stub
   - Worker command bypasses both in local/cluster mode

### 4.3 Missing Integration Points

1. **Reconciliation not called from worker loop:**
   ```python
   def reconcile_tasks(self) -> None:
       """Reconcile task states with Ray."""
       if self.sync_mode or not self.active_tasks:
           return
       # Only reconciles Ray Job API tasks, not local ray tasks
   ```

2. **Retry logic not wired:**
   - `retry.py` has `should_retry()` function
   - Never called from worker command
   - Failed tasks stay FAILED, no automatic retry

3. **Stuck task detection not active:**
   - `reconciliation.py` has `is_task_stuck()` and `mark_task_lost()`
   - Never called from worker loop
   - Tasks can remain stuck indefinitely (known issue from load testing)

---

## 5. Test Project Analysis (UPDATED)

### 5.1 Current Implementation (After Django 6 Integration)

The `testproject/` now serves as a proper example of Django 6 task integration:

1. ✅ **Tasks use `@task` decorator** - Full Django 6 integration
2. ✅ **API uses `.enqueue()`** - Via `/v2/` endpoints
3. ✅ **Type-safe task references** - No manual path strings needed

### 5.2 Django 6 Pattern (NOW IMPLEMENTED)

```python
# testproject/tasks.py (current - using Django 6)
from django.tasks import task

@task
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

# testproject/api.py (current - using .enqueue())
from testproject.tasks import add_numbers

def enqueue_add_v2(request, a: int, b: int):
    result = add_numbers.enqueue(a, b)
    return {"task_id": result.id, "status": result.status.value}
```

### 5.3 Legacy Pattern (Still Supported, Deprecated)

The legacy endpoints using direct model creation are still available
but marked as deprecated:

```python
# Legacy pattern (deprecated but functional)
task = RayTaskExecution.objects.create(
    callable_path="testproject.tasks.add_numbers",
    ...
)
```

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 ~~Critical Priority: Django 6 Task Framework Integration~~ ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** Implemented on January 18, 2026

**Completed Steps:**
1. ✅ Created `django_ray/backends.py` implementing `TaskBackend` ABC
2. ✅ Wired `RayTaskExecution` to Django's task result model
3. ✅ Enabled `TASKS = {"default": {"BACKEND": "django_ray.backends.RayTaskBackend"}}`
4. ✅ Updated testproject to use `@task` decorator and `.enqueue()`
5. ✅ Updated `import_utils.py` to handle Django Task objects

### 6.2 High Priority: Consolidate Ray Execution Modes

**Goal:** Use the runner abstraction consistently.

**Steps:**
1. Implement `RayCoreRunner` properly (not inline)
2. Remove inline `ray.remote` from worker command
3. Route all execution through `BaseRunner` interface
4. Make Ray Job API the default for isolation
5. Make Ray Core optional for high-throughput

### 6.3 High Priority: Wire Up Reliability Features

**Goal:** Activate existing but dormant code.

**Steps:**
1. Call `should_retry()` on task failure
2. Call `is_task_stuck()` in reconciliation loop
3. Call `mark_task_lost()` for orphaned tasks
4. Integrate cancellation into worker loop

### 6.4 Medium Priority: Clean Up Technical Debt

**Steps:**
1. Remove placeholder modules or implement them
2. Consolidate result handling logic
3. Add proper logging throughout
4. Implement metrics collection

### 6.5 Low Priority: Developer Experience

**Steps:**
1. Add task decorator that registers with Django
2. Add automatic task discovery
3. Improve error messages
4. Add CLI tools

---

## 7. Proposed Implementation Order

### Phase A: Django 6 Alignment (2-3 weeks)

1. Research Django 6 `TaskBackend` interface in detail
2. Implement `RayTaskBackend` class
3. Update `RayTaskExecution` to work with Django task results
4. Add `@task` decorator support
5. Update testproject to use Django 6 patterns
6. Update documentation

### Phase B: Ray Execution Consolidation (1-2 weeks)

1. Implement `RayCoreRunner` properly
2. Refactor worker to use runner abstraction
3. Fix Ray Job API issues (PATH, environment)
4. Add integration tests for both modes

### Phase C: Reliability Activation (1 week)

1. Wire retry logic into worker loop
2. Wire stuck detection into reconciliation
3. Wire cancellation into worker loop
4. Add integration tests for reliability

### Phase D: Polish (1 week)

1. Implement metrics collection
2. Clean up placeholder modules
3. Update IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md
4. Final testing and documentation

---

## 8. Impact Assessment

### 8.1 If No Action Taken

- Project remains a custom task queue, not a Django 6 backend
- Cannot benefit from Django ecosystem improvements
- Technical debt continues to accumulate
- Users cannot use standard Django patterns

### 8.2 If Recommendations Implemented

- Full Django 6 task framework compatibility
- Interoperable with other Django task backends
- Reduced technical debt
- Standard developer experience
- Production-ready reliability features

---

## 9. Conclusion

The django-ray project has made significant progress. After the architecture review and immediate implementation work on January 18, 2026, the project is now a **proper Django 6 task backend**.

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Django 6 Task Framework Integration** - The most critical gap has been addressed:
   - `RayTaskBackend` class implementing Django's `BaseTaskBackend`
   - Tasks use `@task` decorator
   - Enqueueing via `.enqueue()` API
   - Result retrieval via `TaskResult` objects

2. **Updated Test Project** - Now demonstrates proper Django 6 patterns:
   - `/v2/` API endpoints using native Django task API
   - Legacy endpoints deprecated but maintained for backward compatibility

### Remaining Work

The Ray execution layer works but has room for improvement:
- Ray Job API exists but is not the primary execution path
- Reliability features (retry, reconciliation, cancellation) need to be wired into the worker loop
- Placeholder modules need implementation or removal

**Next recommended action:** Focus on wiring reliability features (retry, stuck detection) into the worker loop.
