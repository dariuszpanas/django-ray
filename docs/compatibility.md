# Compatibility and Version Policy

## Supported Versions

| Component | Supported |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 |
| Django | 6.0 or newer compatible release |
| Ray | 2.53.0 or newer compatible release |
| Production operating system | Linux recommended |

Python 3.12 is the floor because Django 6.0 requires Python 3.12+, not because Ray does.
Current [Ray releases support a wider Python range](https://pypi.org/project/ray/).

Ray Client and cluster execution are most predictable when the task manager and Ray
cluster use the same Ray version and Python minor version. Patch-version differences
may produce a warning; different minor versions should not be treated as compatible.

Ray Compiled Graph has a separate, exact, fail-closed capability policy because its
native beta channels have narrower version, platform, transport, and process-owner
constraints. The general Ray version range in this table does not enable compilation.
Generic or unresolved host/container context is also insufficient: an eligible row
requires an immutable deployment/image digest plus explicit shared-memory and Ray
object-store profiles.
See [Compiled Graph Compatibility](compiled-graph-compatibility.md).

## Dependency Policy

`pyproject.toml` uses lower bounds so applications can resolve compatible updates
instead of being locked to the versions used for one django-ray release. The committed
`uv.lock` gives contributors and CI a reproducible current environment.

CI covers:

- the committed lock on every supported Python minor;
- minimum direct dependencies on the oldest supported Python;
- the newest resolvable dependencies on the newest supported Python;
- package installation from the built wheel on every supported Python minor.

Updating the lock is therefore separate from raising a package's minimum supported
version. A lower bound should move only when django-ray uses a newer API or the older
dependency is no longer supportable.

## Platforms

Ray publishes platform-specific wheels. A pure-Python django-ray wheel does not imply
that Ray is available on every Python/platform combination.

- Linux is the production target for clusters and Kubernetes.
- Ray's Windows multi-node support remains experimental; Windows is useful for local
  development and tests.
- Ray publishes Linux aarch64 wheels for supported Python versions, but users must
  confirm their OS, architecture, and Python ABI match an available Ray wheel.

Compiled Graph is more restrictive than ordinary Ray use: policy version 2 rejects
Windows, aarch64, Ray Client, GPU transport, and every unverified native tuple before
calling `experimental_compile()`. Dynamic workflows remain supported according to the
general matrix above.
